# UwUify

This application dynamically transforms all text in ArcOS to uwu'ified counterparts. It uses a MutationObserver and some Regex to accomplish this.

## Known problems

- When the process ends, I can't guarantee that the process can reliably revert all uwuified strings back to their original states.
